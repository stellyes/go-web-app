# Go Web App
A simple Go application to serve up a "Hello, world!" string and print how many bytes of data were written to the server console.

## Usage
Navigate to the workspace you've cloned the project into, and run `go run main.go`. This should open the web server on [`https://localhost:4000`](https://localhost:4000), where you can navigate to. This will trigger the web server's print statement, and write to the server console.

**NOTE**: You may have to manually allow the application runtime to receive network requests.
